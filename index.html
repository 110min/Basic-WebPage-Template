                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>Businesses operating within the travel industry has been especially quick to adopt virtual 
                        reality technology and for good reason. Typically, their customers are looking to purchas
                        experiences, rather than products, and virtual reality offers an effective way for marketers
                        to give them a taste of what they can expect.Travel customers usually require lots of information 
                        before they book a hotel room. This may, for instance, require them to read descriptions, view 
                        images, look at videos, read customer reviews or seek opinions on social media. Through intelligent 
                        use of virtual reality, however, this process can be shortened significantly.
                        Many hotels and travel companies are now providing virtual reality elements on their websites 
                        or apps, allowing users to experience a digital version of a hotel room, or even take a look at 
                        one of the nearby attractions. This immersion enables those in the travel industry to provide a 
                        kind of ‘try before you buy’ option for the first time.</p>
